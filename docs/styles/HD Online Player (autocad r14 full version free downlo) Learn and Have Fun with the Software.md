However, AutoCAD R14 is no longer supported by Autodesk, and it is not compatible with newer versions of Windows. If you want to use AutoCAD R14 on your computer, you will need to find a way to download and install it for free. Here are some steps you can follow to do that:
 
1. Go to [this link](https://archive.org/details/AutoCAD_Release_14_Version_14.01_00114-014808-0102_Autodesk_1998) on the Internet Archive website. This is a digital copy of the original AutoCAD R14 CD-ROM that was uploaded by a user[^1^]. You can also go to [this link](https://archive.org/details/auto-cad-r14-cdrom) for another copy of the same CD-ROM[^2^].
2. Click on the "ISO IMAGE" option under the "Download Options" section on the right side of the page. This will download a file named "AutoCAD\_Release\_14\_Version\_14.01\_00114-014808-0102\_Autodesk\_1998.iso" or "auto-cad-r14-cdrom.iso" depending on which link you chose. This file is an image of the CD-ROM that contains all the files and data needed to install AutoCAD R14.
3. Once the download is complete, you will need a software that can mount or burn ISO files. You can use a free program like [PowerISO](https://www.poweriso.com/) or [WinISO](https://www.winiso.com/) for this purpose. Install the software on your computer and run it.
4. Use the software to mount or burn the ISO file you downloaded. If you mount it, you will create a virtual drive on your computer that will act as if you inserted the CD-ROM. If you burn it, you will need a blank CD or DVD and a CD/DVD writer on your computer. You will create a physical copy of the CD-ROM that you can insert into your computer.
5. After mounting or burning the ISO file, open the virtual or physical drive on your computer and look for a file named "setup.exe". Double-click on this file to start the installation process of AutoCAD R14.
6. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation. You will need to enter a serial number and a CD key during the installation. You can use these numbers that were found on the original CD-ROM: Serial Number: 640-00020110 CD Key: 8UUG 00114-094831-4981 00114-094831-0102
7. Once the installation is done, you can launch AutoCAD R14 from your desktop or start menu. Enjoy using this classic CAD software for free!

Note: AutoCAD R14 may not work properly on newer versions of Windows, such as Windows 10. You may encounter errors, crashes, or compatibility issues. To avoid these problems, you can try running AutoCAD R14 in compatibility mode for Windows XP or Windows 98. You can also use a virtual machine software like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/) to create a virtual environment that runs an older version of Windows where AutoCAD R14 can work smoothly.
