# How to Download Acer eRecovery Management for Windows 7
 
If you have an Acer computer running Windows 7, you may want to download Acer eRecovery Management, a software that allows you to create recovery media, backup and restore your system, and reinstall drivers or applications. Acer eRecovery Management is not available for download from the official Acer website, but you can use one of the following methods to obtain it:
 
1. Use Acer Care Center software. Acer Care Center is a program that comes pre-installed on most Acer computers. It lets you create a recovery drive on a USB flash drive, which you can use to reinstall Windows or reset your system to factory defaults. To create a recovery drive using Acer Care Center, follow these steps[^1^]:
    - Type Care Center in the search box and select Acer Care Center from the search results.
    - Select Recovery Management from the menu on the left.
    - Choose the Backup tab.
    - Click the Get Started button next to Backup wireless and LAN drivers.
    - Choose a location to save the drivers and click Next.
    - Insert a USB flash drive and click Next.
    - Wait for the process to complete and click Finish.
2. Contact Acer Technical Support. If you are unable to create a recovery drive using Acer Care Center, you can contact Acer Technical Support at 1-866-695-2237 and request a copy of Acer eRecovery Management for your computer. You may need to provide your serial number, SNID or model number, which you can find on your device or by using the serial number detection utility[^2^].
3. Order the original factory software. If you prefer to have the original factory software for your computer, including Acer eRecovery Management, you can order it from Acer by calling 1-800-910-2237. You will need to pay a fee for shipping and handling. Customers outside the US or Canada should contact Acer Support in their region[^1^].

Acer eRecovery Management is a useful tool that can help you restore your system in case of problems or prepare it for selling or giving away. However, remember that it will not backup your personal files or applications that did not come with your computer, so make sure you have a separate backup of those before using it.
