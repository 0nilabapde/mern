# How to Emulate Feitian Rockey4 USB Dongle with RAR Files
 
Feitian Rockey4 is a USB dongle that provides software protection and licensing for various applications. It is widely used in industries such as gaming, engineering, and education. However, sometimes you may need to emulate the dongle on another computer without having the physical device. This can be useful for backup, testing, or sharing purposes.
 
In this article, we will show you how to emulate Feitian Rockey4 USB dongle with RAR files. RAR files are compressed archives that can store multiple files and folders in a single file. They are commonly used for transferring and storing large files over the internet. By using RAR files, we can create a virtual image of the dongle that can be mounted and recognized by the software that requires it.

The steps are as follows:
 
1. Download and install a dongle emulator software such as MultiKey or VUsbBus. These are free tools that can create and manage virtual USB devices on your computer.
2. Connect the Feitian Rockey4 USB dongle to your computer and run the emulator software. It will detect the dongle and show its information such as serial number, vendor ID, and product ID.
3. Select the dongle and click on "Dump" or "Backup" to create a binary file that contains the data of the dongle. Save the file to a location of your choice.
4. Compress the binary file into a RAR file using a compression software such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. You can also add a password or encryption to the RAR file for extra security.
5. Copy the RAR file to another computer where you want to emulate the dongle. You will also need to install the same emulator software on that computer.
6. Run the emulator software and click on "Add" or "Install" to create a new virtual USB device. Browse and select the RAR file that contains the binary file of the dongle. The emulator will extract and load the data from the RAR file and create a virtual dongle that has the same information as the original one.
7. Restart your computer and run the software that requires the dongle. It should recognize the virtual dongle as if it was the real one and allow you to use its features.

Congratulations! You have successfully emulated Feitian Rockey4 USB dongle with RAR files. You can now use the software without having the physical device. However, please note that this method is only for educational and personal use. Do not use it for illegal or commercial purposes as it may violate the terms and conditions of the software and the dongle manufacturer.
