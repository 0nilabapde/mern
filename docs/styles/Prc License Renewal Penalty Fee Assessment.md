## Renew your license before your birth month
 
The PRC has implemented a new schedule for license renewal based on the first letter of your surname. You can check the schedule on the PRC website[^1^]. However, regardless of your surname, you should renew your license before your birth month to avoid paying a surcharge of 20% of the annual registration fee (ARF)[^2^]. For example, if your ARF is Php 450 and your birth month is June, you should renew your license before June 30 to avoid paying an extra Php 90.
 
## Complete the required CPD units
 
Another requirement for license renewal is the completion of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) units. CPD units are earned by attending seminars, trainings, workshops, and other activities that enhance your professional skills and knowledge. The number of CPD units required varies depending on your profession. You can check the list of CPD requirements on the PRC website[^1^]. If you fail to complete the required CPD units, you will have to pay a fine of Php 1,000 per year of non-compliance[^3^]. For example, if you need 45 CPD units and you only have 30, you will have to pay Php 3,000 as a fine.

## Pay online or through authorized payment channels
 
To avoid long queues and hassle, you can pay your license renewal fee online or through authorized payment channels. You can use credit or debit cards powered by PayMaya, PayMaya wallet, Landbank LinkBiz Portal, UCPB Connect, or BancNet Online[^3^]. These payment options charge a small convenience fee ranging from Php 8 to Php 25. You can also pay in cash at any PRC office or service center[^1^]. Make sure to pay the exact amount as indicated in your online application form.
 
## Print your claim stub and claim your license
 
After paying your license renewal fee, you will receive a claim stub that indicates the date and place where you can claim your license. You can also check the status of your license online[^1^]. You should claim your license within six months from the date of payment. Otherwise, you will have to pay a storage fee of Php 30 per month[^2^]. For example, if you paid your fee on January 1 and claimed your license on July 31, you will have to pay an extra Php 180 as a storage fee.
 
## Conclusion
 
Renewing your PRC license is an important responsibility as a professional. However, it can also be expensive if you do not follow the rules and regulations. To avoid penalty fees when renewing your PRC license, you should renew it before your birth month, complete the required CPD units, pay online or through authorized payment channels, and claim your license within six months from the date of payment. By doing so, you can save money and time while keeping your license valid.
