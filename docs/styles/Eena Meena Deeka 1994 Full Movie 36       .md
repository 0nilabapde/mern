He plans to rob a bank with his gang, but things go wrong when he bumps into Eena (Rishi Kapoor), a bumbling photographer who is mistaken for Deeka by the police. Eena is also pursued by Meena (Juhi Chawla), a rich heiress who falls in love with him at first sight. Eena and Deeka end up on the run together, while Meena tries to help them out of their troubles.
