## Why Choose Maple 2020?
 
Maple 2020 is not just a math software. It is a comprehensive environment that supports every stage of the mathematical workflow. With Maple 2020, you can:

- Solve math problems easily and accurately, without worrying that you've lost a minus sign somewhere.
- Solve math problems quickly that you could never do by hand (or that you wouldn't want to do by hand because life is too short!).
- Solve problems from virtually any branch of mathematics or field that relies on mathematics, such as calculus, algebra, differential equations, statistics, control design, linear algebra, physics, optimization, group theory, differential geometry, signal processing, special functions, number theory, financial modeling,
etc. etc.- Keep problems, solutions, visualizations,
and explanations all together in a single,- easy-to-follow document,
so you don't have to waste time reconstructing your thought processes.- Develop complex solutions using a sophisticated programming language designed for mathematics,
so your code is shorter,- easier to write,
easier to debug,and easier to maintain.- Create interactive applications for yourself,
your students,or your colleagues,without having to be an expert programmer,and share them over the web.- Learn new concepts,
refresh your skills,or explore new topics with a variety of learning resources available in Maple.
